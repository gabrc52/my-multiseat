# my-multiseat
Two computers from one computer! :D

Some bash scripts to make multiseat (two people using the same computer at the same time, with an additional mouse and keyboard) easier, allowing some configuration.

`ms`: Creates a new seat (a new Xephyr window)

`ms-conf`: Configuration: change the keyboard and mouse that will be used to control the additional seat

`sdesktop`: Lightweight desktop environment for the seat

Dependencies:

* Any Linux distro
* kdesu
* Xephyr
* VirtualGL
* Zenity
* Openbox
* LXQt
